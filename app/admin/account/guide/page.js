{`**Why Use Photo Limits?**
â€¢ Control costs by limiting total photos per event
â€¢ Ensure fair distribution of photos among guests
â€¢ Manage printer resources and supplies
â€¢ Create different packages (e.g., 2 photos per person)

**Types of Limits You Can Set:**

1. **Total Event Photo Limit**
   â€¢ Controls the total number of photos for the entire event
   â€¢ Leave empty for unlimited photos
   â€¢ Perfect for:
     - Budget control
     - Limited supplies
     - Package-based events
   â€¢ Example: Set to 100 for a 50-person event with 2 photos each

2. **Photos Per Person**
   â€¢ Controls how many photos each guest can take
   â€¢ Two options:
     - Set a specific number (e.g., 2 photos)
     - Enable unlimited photos
   â€¢ Perfect for:
     - Package deals
     - VIP guests
     - Open photo booths
   â€¢ Example: Set to 2 for a standard package

**How Limits Work:**
â€¢ When a guest enters their email:
  - System checks their previous submissions
  - Shows remaining photos they can take
  - Prevents access if they've reached their limit

â€¢ For the total event limit:
  - System tracks all photos taken
  - Shows remaining photos for the event
  - Prevents new photos when limit is reached

**Best Practices:**
â€¢ For weddings: Consider unlimited photos per person
â€¢ For corporate events: Set specific limits per person
â€¢ For markets: Use total event limit based on supplies
â€¢ For package deals: Match limits to package prices

**Changing Limits:**
â€¢ You can adjust limits anytime during the event
â€¢ Changes only affect new photo submissions
â€¢ Previous photos remain in the system
â€¢ Great for extending limits if needed`}
